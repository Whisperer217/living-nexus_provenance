## v2.34.2 — April 30, 2026 (Book-Tab Drawer Collapse Fix)

### What Shipped

**LiveActivityPanel — Fixed-Position Tab Strip**
- `BookSpineTabs` was previously rendered as a child of the sliding panel div in `LiveActivityPanel`. When the panel translated off-screen (`translateX(-272px)`), the tabs slid with it — making them invisible and unclickable.
- Fix: The tab strip is now rendered as a **separate fixed-position sibling** outside the sliding panel. A `<div className="hidden md:block fixed z-[36]">` container holds the `BookSpineTabs` and transitions its `left` property in sync with the panel's `transform` transition (same cubic-bezier).
- When closed: `left: 0px` — tabs protrude from the left screen edge.
- When open: `left: 272px` — tabs sit at the right edge of the open panel.
- `PlaylistDrawer` (right side) already had this architecture correct — no change needed there.

**WhatsNewModal bumped to v2.34.2**
- Added v2.34.2 entry (drawer fix, StoreTrackCard play fix, Featured Creators filter).
- Added v2.34.0 entry (Book-Tab Spine Drawers redesign).

### TypeScript
- 0 errors.

## v2.34.0 — April 30, 2026 (Book-Tab Spine Drawer Redesign)

### What Shipped

**BookSpineTabs Component (`client/src/components/BookSpineTabs.tsx`)**
- New reusable component for vertical protruding spine tabs on side drawers.
- `side="left"`: tabs protrude from the right edge of the left drawer.
- `side="right"`: tabs protrude from the left edge of the right drawer.
- Cinzel small-caps labels, gold foil active state, warm near-black parchment interior.
- Active tab lifts slightly with gold glow; inactive tabs show on hover.
- Dot indicator support for live pulse on the Live tab.
- Toggle-collapse: clicking the active tab calls `onDrawerToggle()` to close the drawer.

**LiveActivityPanel — Book-Tab Redesign**
- Left panel tabs: Live / Playing / Tips on the right spine edge.
- Near-black solid background (`#0a0806` gradient), no backdrop blur.

**PlaylistDrawer — Book-Tab Redesign**
- Right panel tabs: New / Trending / Liked / Build on the left spine edge.
- Fixed-position tab strip outside the sliding panel (correct architecture from the start).

## v2.33.0 — April 29, 2026 (Live Waveform Visualizer + Reaction Fix)

### What Shipped

**Live Waveform Visualizer (PlayerBar)**
- New `client/src/hooks/useWaveformVisualizer.ts` hook draws a real-time oscilloscope waveform to a `<canvas>` element in the compact player bar.
- Uses `getByteTimeDomainData` (time-domain samples) for the wave shape — smooth bezier curve, full bar width, vertically centered.
- Color shifts with frequency content: violet at rest → gold on bass hits → cyan on mid-heavy passages.
- Shares the same Web Audio graph (AudioContext + AnalyserNode) as `useFrequencyGlow` via `window.__lnAudioCtx/Analyser/Source` globals — no double-connect, no extra CPU.
- `useFrequencyGlow` bumped `fftSize` from 256 → 2048 so both hooks get high-resolution data.
- Canvas is `position: absolute`, `pointer-events: none`, `zIndex: 0` — sits behind all controls, never intercepts clicks.
- Toggled by the existing `∿` Frequency Glow button (same localStorage key `ln-player-glow`).
- Fades in/out with `opacity` transition (0.4s ease) when toggled.

**Reaction Error Fix (Production)**
- `server/db.ts` connection pool: added `connectTimeout: 10000` and `idleTimeout: 60000` to handle ECONNRESET on idle TiDB serverless connections.
- `client/src/pages/SongDetailPage.tsx` `onError` handler: replaced `toast.error(err?.message || ...)` with `toast.error("Reaction failed — please try again")` — raw SQL no longer leaks to the UI.

### Manus Pub Action Required
- Publish the new checkpoint to deploy the waveform visualizer and reaction fix to production.

## v2.32.5 — April 29, 2026 (Beat-Reactive Glow Pulse)

### What Shipped

**useFrequencyGlow.ts — Full rewrite**

The frequency glow now pulses with the music instead of linearly tracking raw frequency values.

**Beat detection + peak/decay envelope:**
- Each RAF frame, bass energy is compared against a running `peakRef` value
- When current bass exceeds `peak × 1.15` (BEAT_THRESHOLD), a beat is detected — `peak` snaps up to current bass energy
- Between beats, `peak` decays exponentially at `×0.88` per frame (~60fps → full decay in ~0.5s)
- Mid/high contribute to peak at lower weights (0.4× and 0.15×)
- The `peak` envelope drives all glow spread/opacity values — not raw frequency

**Color shifting:**
- Idle/low energy: deep violet `(138, 43, 226)`
- Bass hit: gold/amber `(196, 154, 40)` — Living Nexus brand color
- Mid-heavy passages: cyan/teal `(56, 189, 248)`
- High-freq transients: white shimmer edge `(255, 255, 255)`
- Colors interpolate smoothly based on relative band energy each frame

**Glow layers:**
- Primary upward pulse (above bar) — 0–56px spread driven by peak
- Secondary mid layer
- High-freq white edge flash on transients
- Inset glow on bar itself (always visible)
- Side glow (left + right edges)
- Subtle downward pulse

**No schema changes. No new procedures.**

### Manus Pub Action Required
- None — change is in `useFrequencyGlow.ts` only. Publish to deploy.

---

## v2.32.4 — April 29, 2026 (Frequency Glow Fix + Audio Pipeline Audit)

### What Shipped

**Frequency Glow Visual Fix (PlayerContext + useFrequencyGlow)**
- Root cause: `Audio` element created without `crossOrigin = "anonymous"` — Web Audio API's `createMediaElementSource()` requires this before any S3 URL is loaded. Without it, the browser CORS-taints the stream and blocks the analyser from reading frequency data.
- Fix 1: `PlayerContext.tsx` — `new Audio()` now sets `crossOrigin = "anonymous"` before any `src` is assigned
- Fix 2: `useFrequencyGlow.ts` — `buildGlowShadow` now radiates in all directions: upward (above bar), inset (on the bar itself, always visible), left/right sides, and a subtle downward pulse. Previously only upward, which was hidden behind page content above the bar.

**Audio Playback Pipeline Audit — Confirmed Correct**
- Pipeline: `song.fileUrl` (DB) → `mapToSongData.fileUrl` → `toTrack(s).audioUrl` → `addAndPlay(track)` → `audio.src = safeAudioUrl(url)` → `audio.play()`
- `safeAudioUrl` correctly re-encodes path segments for filenames with spaces
- Tracks with null `fileUrl` silently skip (play button hidden on those cards — by design)
- Audio playback issues reported by users are likely network/internet related (S3 URLs require stable connection)

### Manus Pub Action Required
- None — all changes are in `PlayerContext.tsx` and `useFrequencyGlow.ts`. Publish to deploy.

---

## v2.32.3 — April 29, 2026 (Keeper Notes Drawer + What's New + LSP Flush)

### What Shipped

**Keeper Notes Drawer (KeeperPage.tsx)**
- `NOTES` button added to Keeper screen top bar (gold pill, BookOpen icon, live count badge)
- Clicking opens a right-side `Sheet` drawer listing all notes saved from the Keeper chat
- Each note card shows: title, persona slug, date, optional tag badge, 3-line content preview, optional image thumbnail
- **Reload button** (↺): copies note content to clipboard and navigates to `/keeper-chat` for immediate re-use
- **Delete button**: calls `trpc.keeper.deleteNote` with optimistic cache invalidation
- Empty state shown when no notes exist yet
- Notes are lazy-loaded (query only fires when drawer is open)

**tRPC procedures used (already existed, no changes):**
- `trpc.keeper.listNotes` — returns `KeeperNote[]` sorted newest-first
- `trpc.keeper.deleteNote` — deletes by ID, scoped to authed user

**What's New modal** — bumped to v2.32.2, reactions fix entry added

**LSP watcher** — stale conflict markers cleared via `touch drizzle/schema.ts`

### Manus Pub Action Required
- None — all changes are in `KeeperPage.tsx` and `WhatsNewModal.tsx`. Publish to deploy.

## v2.32.2 — April 28, 2026 (Bugfix: Emoji Reactions Broken — Slimdoggy Report)

### Root Cause
The live `songReactions` table had a column named `emoji` (varchar 10, utf8mb4) with a composite unique index on `(songId, userId, emoji)`. The Drizzle schema expected a column named `type` (varchar 16). Every reaction toggle silently failed — the optimistic update flashed and rolled back with no error toast shown to the user.

### DB Migration Applied (live, already executed)
1. Dropped composite unique index `songReactions_unique` (covered `emoji`)
2. Dropped `emoji` column
3. Added `type` column: `varchar(32)` utf8mb4 (safe ASCII slugs, no charset issues)
4. Added unique index `songReactions_user_song_type_idx` on `(userId, songId, type)`

### Frontend Changes
- `REACTIONS` array replaced with `REACTION_SLUGS`: `["fire", "love", "wow", "clap", "thumbsup", "thumbsdown", "mindblown", "+"]`
- `REACTION_EMOJI` map converts slugs → emoji for display only (never stored in DB)
- Added `onError` toast to `toggleReactionMutation`: users now see "Reaction failed — please try again" instead of silent rollback

### Schema Updated
`drizzle/schema.ts` — `songReactions.type` is now `varchar(32)`, `createdAt` is `bigint` (matches live DB)

### Manus Pub Action Required
- None — reactions now work. Publish the site to push the fix to `livingnexus.org`.

---

## v2.32.1 — April 2026 (Bugfix: Creator Links, Playlist-Add, Share URL Audit)

### Bug Fixes

**StoreCreatorCard — broken creator profile links fixed**
- Was: `/creator/${artistHandle}` (string handle — route expects numeric ID → 404 on all creator cards)
- Now: `/creator/${creator.id}` (numeric ID — always resolves correctly)
- Impact: all creator cards on Home page showcase rows and Explore page now navigate correctly

**StoreTrackCard — context menu added (3-dot button on hover)**
- New `MoreVertical` button appears top-right on card hover
- Menu options: Play Next, Add to List (sub-panel with user's playlists), Go to Song, View Creator, Copy WID Link / Copy Link
- Add to List uses `trpc.playlists.addTrack` — shows all user playlists; creates new list if user has none
- Context menu is a portal (renders in `document.body`) — not clipped by card overflow

**Share URL routing — confirmed working in code**
- `/share/:wid` is handled by Express `shareRouter` before CDN intercept
- Serves full OG/Twitter/Discord meta tags for scrapers
- Browsers are immediately redirected to `/song/:id` via meta refresh + JS redirect
- Root cause of broken share links on deployed site: needs a Publish to pick up latest server changes

**Profile surface — dual-profile clarified (no code change needed)**
- `/profile` = logged-in user's private command center
- `/creator/:id` = canonical public profile for any creator (all tracks, albums, collections, projects)
- `CreatorProfilePage` already shows full track list, albums grouped by collectionTag, and collections
- "Add to My List" context menu option is available to all logged-in users on any creator's profile

### Manus Pub Action Required
- None — all fixes are in shared components. Publish the site to fix the share URL issue on the deployed domain.

## v2.31.0 — Phase 68 — April 2026

### What Shipped

**Bug Fix: Frequency Glow toggle was silencing audio**

- `useFrequencyGlow` hook rewritten — audio graph stays permanently connected
- Toggle now controls only the RAF visualizer animation loop, not the audio node graph

ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN playerAssetType VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'cover';
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN aiToolSuno BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN aiToolUdio BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN aiToolSonato BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN aiToolOther BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

- `keeper.setAttributes` — sets all 5 attribute scores (protected)

**KeeperAttrsContext** (`client/src/contexts/KeeperAttrsContext.tsx`) — React context that loads attributes and exposes them to all Keeper components.

**Manus Pub needs:** Attribute sliders in the Keeper settings panel consume `trpc.keeper.getAttributes` and `trpc.keeper.setAttributes`.

---
